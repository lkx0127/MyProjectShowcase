# MyProjects
Portfolio Website.

This website showcases my key projects in AWS cloud development, web development, machine learning, mobile app development, and robotic process automation (RPA).

Each project includes a detailed description, the technologies used (such as AWS services like S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Rekognition), web frameworks, machine learning models, and mobile or RPA solutions. Video explanations are also provided for each project, giving insight into their purpose and outcomes.

You can explore each project to view its purpose, technology stack, and results.
