# MyProjects
Portfolio Website.

This website showcases my key projects in AWS cloud development, web development, and machine learning.

Each project includes details about the technologies used, such as AWS services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Rekognition), web frameworks, and machine learning models, along with project descriptions and outcomes.

You can explore each project to view its purpose, technology stack, and results.
